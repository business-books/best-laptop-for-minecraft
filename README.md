">best laptop for Minecraft</a>? Nice question, heh.

Minecraft is one of the most popular computer games of all time. She appeared back in 2011 and still does not leave the Olympus of gamers.

In terms of the number of sales, Minecraft is second only to the no less legendary Tetris. Gradually, the game becomes more complicated, programmers add mods that expand the capabilities of players. But all this requires new resources from the system, so when choosing a computer package, you need to take into account the system requirements of your favorite games. What should be the ideal computer for Minecraft lovers?

If you played Minecraft at the dawn of its appearance and decided to plunge back into childhood on the same computer, then during the game you may encounter bugs and brakes. It's just that the system requirements of the famous game have grown. Its gameplay is simple, in fact the whole game comes down to moving cubes, but programmers make sure that the game can withstand the competition of more complex and branched games.

Over time, Minecraft began to consume more RAM, and the load on the processor also increased. The standard version of the game does not have special requirements for a video card, but if you have graphic mods, you will have to take care of good graphics. Even ancient computers that made it back to the time of its appearance do a good job with Minecraft, however, there may be performance problems. To play the basic version of Minecraft, you need a GTX1050 graphics card, an AMD Athlon or Intel Pentium processor. The amount of RAM must be at least 8 GB. It is not necessary to choose stationary versions of computers for Minecraft - it will also be quite capable of a laptop. RAM here should also be at least 8 GB, the processor is from Rizen 3 and Core i3. For color contrast and image accuracy, a Vega 8 or GeForce MX 150/250 video card will suffice.

There are many computers and laptops for Minecraft that fit these parameters. For example, an excellent model of a gaming computer, which is quite capable of not only Minecraft. Or here, a more budget model, but this does not lose in terms of characteristics. Looking to buy a good gaming PC?

By the way, more about the system requirements. With regard to Minecraft, like any other game, a simple principle applies - the better the characteristics of your computer, the more likely it is that the game will go perfectly. While playing Minecraft, the main load falls on the processor and RAM, which means that it is better to select these components with a margin. At least 8 gigs of RAM, and preferably 12-16, so that there is more than enough space to store temporary data when the game modifications are running.

There are fans of the game who install shaders - updates that change the graphics of the game in principle, and for their work, unlike the undemanding classic Minecraft, you need a powerful video card of the latest generation.

Every year, professional programmers and just dedicated fans of the game release its updates - so now is the time to return to the game, which has already entered its second decade. And for this, the store offers lighter and more compact models than desktop computers - gaming laptops. For example, here is a great model at a good price. But this is an option for those who consider computer games their main hobby, and even a profession.
